An HB truncation error may be present.
o The HB truncation error is due to using a finite order 
  (number of harmonics) in the representation of the
  circuit signals.

---------------------------------------------------------
I__48.DIODE1.a          1.641e-02       >       1.233e-06
N__14                   1.267e-02       >       1.202e-06

N__6                    2.912e-03       >       1.684e-06

o Number of waveforms violating the HB truncation error check:
        4 out of 4 waveforms.
o Estimated max HB truncation error: 1.641e-02 @ waveform I__48.DIODE1.a .
o The maximal HB truncation error estimate is greater than the 
  achieved tolerance of 1.233e-06 for this waveform.
o A time-domain plot of the N__40 waveform may show the error as 
  Gibbs ripples.
o To reduce the error, increase the order (number of harmonics) 
  and re-simulate.
